                <p>This series represents a recent foray into the world of AI image generation using an online tool
                    called Midjourney - you could describe it as a dialogue between me and my artificially intelligent
                    alter ego, Andy Inkblot.</p>
                <p> Depending on your perspective this either represents a fantastic opportunity to explore new methods
                    of image creation to generate new stories and unforeseen connections or, on the other hand, it just
                    completely undermines the cultural perception of western art as being the celebration and expression
                    of individual identity through creative genius and skill. I have the utmost admiration for the
                    latter. I am in awe of those who have that skill and who apply it in their examination of the world,
                    but I am also open to serendipity. In truth, the ground shifted quite a while back - those dadaists
                    and surrealists were upsetting people well over a hundred years ago with their found objects and
                    urinals, and the role of generative art has been established in music for many years now. Take Brian
                    Eno for example, how do you describe his work with programming loops? Is he a composer, a curator, a
                    technician, an editor or a combination of all these things? And, why precisely, does it matter to
                    you so much? Why do we need to define things so?</p>
                <p>Possibly it comes down to whether you want to believe that art (or music? Or contemporary dance? Or
                    knitting?) offers a doorway into another person’s soul - or is an art gallery just a hall of mirrors
                    reflecting you back at yourself. It is not a binary decision really: there is room for nuance, but
                    each of us filters our perceptions through the history of our experience. We are all different, but
                    it is the oscillation between difference and communality that makes for the richness of the dialogue
                    that art inspires.</p>
                <p>So, with The Bacton Seal, I invite you to make your own stories. For me it is a world of monsters and
                    demons with the occasional friend. They don’t have fixed correspondents in the real world; their
                    boundaries are fluid. The roots of it lie in some collages I made back in the early 90s, but those
                    creatures are now being regarded by a much older man - more mellow perhaps and more attuned to the
                    natural world now that my nearest neighbours tend to be seals and jackdaws.</p>
                <p>I am fascinated by these non-human societies that surround us and, for the most part, remain
                    invisible or ignored. I am envious of their ways and it makes me consider the earlier,
                    pre-technology societies that inhabited these parts back when East Anglia extended all the way to
                    the continent of Europe. The stuff of shamans and totemic beliefs. This is a very modern way of
                    addressing that which is most primitive.</p>
